        "The main point, here, is to help prepare you for deep learning in the real world, where 10% (or less) of your time will be spent thinking up a new idea and 90% of your time will be spent figuring out how to get a deep learning framework to play nicely. Debugging these frameworks can be extremely difficult at times, because most bugs don’t raise an error and print out a stack trace. Most bugs lie hidden within the code, keeping the network from training as it should (even if it appears to be training somewhat)."
